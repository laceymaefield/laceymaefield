Capstone Project 2 Final

Utilized the data from WineEnthusiast (sourced from Kaggle) that was compiled during the week of June 25th 2017. This data consists of wine varieties, origins, descriptions, points, and prices across over 130,000 different kinds. This data was contained in a CSV and wrangled and modeled using Python 3. The goal of this project was to determine if there were any significant relationships between the various factors (description/points/price/location), which could then be used by wine sellers to boost sales.
